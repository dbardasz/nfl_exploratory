Exploring play mix with NFL Next Gen Stats


Unfinished Python visualizations hosted on Streamlit servers: https://nfl-visualizations.streamlit.app/

Ultimately the goal of this project is to create a predicitive model based on certain inputs to determine whether a team will pass or run on any given play.

## nfl_visualizations.ipynb
This file was mainly used to do some preliminary dives into the data provided by next gen stats from AWS. There is a significant amount of data so just exploring the data and creating some simple visualizations which can then drive a deeper dive with streamlit visualizations.

## nfl_streamlit.py
This python file is what is read by the streamlit app. It creates the filters for each visualization and the formatting of the app itself.
